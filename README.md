# Intro

This is a quick nodejs based REST API server I'm setting up to use as a reference for more advanced projects in the future.

## Supported methods

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

Examples for curl commands to run each method can be found as a commend above the method code

## Commands

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

`docker build . --tag rest-api`

# TODO:
For whatever reason GET method for all keeps accepting the requests sent for the GET method for specific ID.
