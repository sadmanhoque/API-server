# Intro

This is a quick nodejs based REST API server I'm setting up to use as a reference for more advanced projects in the future.

## Supported methods

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

Examples for curl commands to run each method can be found as a commend above the method code

## Commands

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

# TOTO:
* For the POST and PUT method have something that checks the correct form of {"username": "STRING", "password": "STRING"}
* For GET all method find a way to encrypt the password as SHA1(USERNAME+PASSWORD)
